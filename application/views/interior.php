			<p>Do you want to be involved in selecting colors and working with decorative concepts, but you struggle with making the right choices?</p>
			<p>Are you seeking superior design and decorative work and need someone you can trust?
			</p>
			<p><strong>Roof and Wall Saver, Inc.</strong> will provide superior service and first class professional interior painting of your home or business. We focuses our attention and efforts on your project from start to finish. Great customer service and long-lasting paint jobs are our trademark.</p>
			<p><strong>Protecting the Surface</strong> – Cover up and masking is the first of several important steps. Masking off the baseboards and other areas is very important to protect against roller splatters. We use clean plastic to cover all furniture and canvasses to cover the floors. Hardware will need protection and in some cases must be removed. It is always important to cover thoroughly, so we can protect your beautiful home.</p>
			<p><strong>Preparing the Surface</strong> – All holes and cracks must be filled with spackle or caulking, being careful to match the existing texture. Excessively dirty surfaces must be cleaned before applying paint. Trim surfaces (doors and casings) need to be lightly sanded with fine sandpaper before application of paint.</p>
			<p><strong>Painting the Surface</strong> – Application on walls, ceilings and trim are typically done using brushes and rollers with extension poles. Care must be taken to apply the paint evenly and with proper coverage to give a professional finished look. The best materials and tools, along with expert application, ensure a great finished product.</p>
			<p><strong>Quality Control</strong> - After the application of paint passes thorough inspections, we unmask everything, remove the plastic from furniture and remove the canvasses from floors. All trash is removed and thrown away.</p>
			<p>Whether your painting needs involve a small bedroom or a complete repaint, strict attention to detail from initial consultation to final cleanup is made. Roof and Wall Saver, Inc. always looking to improve on customer satisfaction and a better finished product. Endless time is spent learning the latest techniques and staying up on the latest and best products available.</p>
			<p>Whatever your vision may be, we have what it takes to make it happen. We offer peace of mind and have a wealth of references.</p>
